    <h1>5.Groups of selectors</h1>
    <p>
        A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separeated list. White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.

    <div class="outside">
        CSS example: <br>
        <br>
        In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br>
        <br>
        h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
        h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
        h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
        <br>
        is equivalent to: <br>
        <br>
        h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }


    </div>
